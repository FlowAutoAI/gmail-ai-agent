**What is the Lego Investment Tool?**
The Lego Investment Tool is a completely FREE online resource designed to help users evaluate the investment potential of Lego sets. Simply enter or select a Lego set to see how it scores across a set of investment factors, aiding your decision making — whether you’re an avid collector or a curious investor.

**How Does It Work?**
Our tool analyzes each set using a unique scoring system. We aggregate publicly available data and market trends, then apply a set of scoring factors (detailed below) to help you assess whether a Lego set could make a smart investment.

**Scoring Factors & Definitions**

1. **Retirement Factor:**  
   *Is it retiring soon?*  
   Sets that are about to be retired by Lego are often more sought after and likely to increase in value.

2. **Discount Factor:**  
   *Current market price vs. RRP*  
   Takes into account how much a set is selling for compared to its official Recommended Retail Price (RRP). Bigger discounts improve this score.

3. **Theme Factor:**  
   *Popularity of the theme*  
   Based on demand and collectibility of the set’s Lego theme (e.g., Star Wars, Technic, Harry Potter).

4. **Minifig Factor:**  
   *Value of included figures*  
   Assesses the value and uniqueness of any minifigures included in the set.

5. **Scarcity Factor:**  
   Evaluates how rare or difficult to find the set is on the current market.

6. **Part Out Factor:**  
   Considers the potential value of selling the set’s individual parts separately.

7. **Mismatch Factor:**  
   Highlights any inconsistencies or unique situations (such as unusual regional releases or packaging errors) that might affect the set’s value.
